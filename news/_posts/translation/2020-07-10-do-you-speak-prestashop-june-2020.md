Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in May.

## Project news


### First news, Esperanto is on the rise :fire:

I am thrilled to let you know that Esperanto has been on the rise since the past month. From the beginning of May to the end of June, the Esperanto translation project went from 25% to 34% words translated, that is to say a 9% evolution. I wish to take this opportunity to thank mirmal and Milan Kolka (milankolka) for your work! :heart_eyes: 

Many of you dedicate their time to contribute to the PrestaShop projects on Crowdin but cannot validate translations because you don’t have the rights. I thus wanted to tell you to not hesitate in [asking me](https://crowdin.com/profile/june.byun) if you wish to become a proofreader. It would allow you to suggest and approve the strings you and others translate.

### Daily language packs updates

In the [last monthly report](https://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-may-2020/), I explained how the translation packs are updated in PrestaShop now. What has to be kept in mind is that only translations of the 1.7.7 PrestaShop version translation projects can be updated and that it has to be manually exported and uploaded to one’s PrestaShop. 

But the good news is that an issue has been created to solve this inconvenience and to make all translations available for PrestaShops, regardless of their version. :sparkles: You can follow the progress of this issue [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/20011).

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, the PrestaShop team would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated: corona2019ncov, Daniel Hlavacek (Hlavtox), Gabi Manea (gabimaneaonline), Maureen Mwende (MsKendi), Pharit Chotkhakkhanan (pharit), Semih Tekin (semihtekin) and Waleed Butt (waleedbutt112). See you soon on Crowdin… and in PrestaShop :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A huge thank you to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other proofreaders! Thanks to you too!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important to keep a high level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations! :fire:

At the end of June 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (52% vs 11%).
* **Galician** (100% vs 59%).
* **Esperanto** (34% vs 0%).
* **Tagalog** (48% vs 24%).

![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2020/06/build-crowdin-proofreading-june20.png)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please contact PrestaShop with the language you'd like to proofread: just send an email to translation@prestashop.com. Your help is needed!

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month! :raising_hand:
